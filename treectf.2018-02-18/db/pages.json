CTFs are a type of computer security competition that's very similar to puzzle hunts. Certain pieces of information, called \"flags\", are placed on servers, encrypted, hidden, or otherwise stored somewhere difficult to access. During the competition, different challenges are released which allow the participants to reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, and do whatever it takes to capture that flag. When a team submits this flag to a scoring page, they will get points.</p>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://ctfs.github.io/resources/\">Practice resources</a></p>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://jacobedelman.gitbooks.io/hsctf-3-practice-problems/content/\">Sample problems</a> </p>\r\n    <p style=\"margin-top: 30px;\"><b>Logistics:</b> This event runs from 1pm-5pm on Saturday, Feb 17th.
